package views

  =============================== twirl templates ===============

  The problem that we have here is:

   ===> We want a template files to be used as the body of our HTTP responses, so we need to define
        how to make a Play result from a template rendering result. So what we need for do that:

        - Implement a Format:
            class Csv
            object Csv
            object CsvFormat

            All necessary info commented on view.Cvs

   ====> We need to asociate the file extension to the format:

        - rot_project/scalaplay/modules/apirest/build.sbt ===>

                TwirlKeys.templateFormats += ("csv" -> "views.CsvFormat")
