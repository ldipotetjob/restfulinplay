    *  Provides all implicit conversion needed for the operations related with Cassandra
    *
    *  implicit def resultSetFutureToScala => this type is important if we want to access in asynchronous mode
    *  to cassandra Data because datastax drivers works with ResultSetFuture and Scala Future works with
    *  ResultSet that is an Iterable.
    *
    *  =======================================================
    *
    *  implicit def rowToMatch => this is the core of our operation because we will receive always a Row of something
    *  and the transform it in the model that we want. So each model must have its specific implicit.
    *
    *  =========================================================
    *
    *  implicit class ListOf[A] => this implicit is valid for all of collection, you can think of it more or less
    *  as Ascription. We have a List[A] => List[B] an of course we must have an implicit conversion A => B
