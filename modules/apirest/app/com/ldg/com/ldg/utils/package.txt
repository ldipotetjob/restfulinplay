=== EagerBindings ===>

Best practice: Define a trait for a component. So you have tha trait an the other class that extends/implement
               that trait. Doing that you can different implementations as in our case:

               - a real implementation: services.DataServices
               - mock implementation: com.ldg.play.test.mockDataServices

root/class Module ==> another example of Eager binding in this case as a Singleton.
