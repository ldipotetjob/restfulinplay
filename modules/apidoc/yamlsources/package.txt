=============  Documenting Api with Swagger   ====================

==> Problems NOT solved by SWAGGER ===>

    - Can NOT modify Conten-type so you can modify the accept by the api and it will imply that
      you can selet the content-type response. BUT if you want to set a DEFAULT content-type in your
      request it is NOT possible.

==> This is de way how you can solve Maps in swagger ==>
