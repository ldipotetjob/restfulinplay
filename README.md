## Implementing Restful services in an Scala ecosystem with Play Framework 

For any project in this repository you will need to install the following softwares:

* jdk 1.7+
* scala 2.11.x
* sbt 0.13.11+

We have implemented here:

* Rest Service with normal actions
* Rest Services with action builder [processing http resquest with JSON][modifiying request and response][parsing body]
* Implementing logging in all activities.
* Error hanldling of request/response.

**Each package in the source code has a file (package.txt) that explains the fundamentals of that specific package.**
